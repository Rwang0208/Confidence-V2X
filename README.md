# Confidence-V2X: Confidence-Driven Sparse Communication for Efficient V2X Cooperative Perception

This repository contains the official implementation of **Confidence-V2X**, a novel multimodal end-to-end autonomous driving algorithm presented in our paper:  
**"Confidence-Driven Sparse Communication for Efficient V2X Cooperative Perception"**.  

 Confidence-V2X introduces a novel method to achieve a balance between object detection accuracy and communication load for V2X cooperative perception.
